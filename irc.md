# IRC

Internet Relay Chat (IRC) is where you can find "chat rooms" to ask for help with various questions.  I'll show you how to join the #perl6 (http://perl6.org/community/irc) chat room and a bit of etiquette for asking questions.

First off, you need to find an IRC client.  On Unix platforms, you might like to use a command-line utility called "ircii."  On the Mac, I prefer to use Colloquy.  Regardless, you need to connect to the server "irc.freenode.net" and then the chat room called "#perl6."  

Once you're in the room, just post your question and patiently wait for an answer.  Be very precise about what's not working.  It's probably best to go to a site like "pastie.org" or "lpaste.net" and paste a *minimum test case* for what's troubling you.  Do not paste hundreds of lines of code.  Write a small script that illustrates just one problem you are having.  (You actually may find that this exercise helps you find your own errors.)
