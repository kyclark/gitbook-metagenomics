# Git basics

Linus Torvalds (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds) is well known for creating the Linux operating system.  Managing all the source code for Linux became onerous with existing systems, so he created "git" to do that, too.  We'll learn enough git to get some things done.

# Github

Github is a for-profit business that provides git hosting services.  They offer free accounts for individuals and groups.  When you have completed an assignment, you will "push" it to Github.  When assignments are due, I will "pull" your code down to check it.  When you are done with class, you will have a public repository of code you can point to as evidence of your skills in both coding and source code management.  So, the first step is that you create a Github account.  Go do that.
