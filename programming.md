You absolutely must learn to program.  If that makes you sad, you'll be even sadder to know that you'll probably need to know 2 or 3 languages, at least -- bash, something like Perl/Python/Ruby, almost certainly R, maybe PHP, perhaps c or Java.  It depends on what you do.  Each language has a niche, and you're going to be more productive if you know more than one.  We are going to teach our students enough bash and Perl 6 to be productive.  Once you learn the basics of reading/writing files, iterating through loops (for/while), reporting errors and such, then you can move on to most any other language (except perhaps Haskell).
