# Bioinformatics

The field of "bioinformatics" is biology plus data science.  For the latter, most people find Unix-like operating systems to be the most efficient way to conduct research. Almost all our tools run in Unix, most of them from the command line, so the bioinformatician must know how to move data around, run programs, and chain the output of one program into another to create analysis pipelines.

# Metagenomics

Metagenomics is a subset of bioinformatics where we deal with unknown communities of organisms comprised of bacteria, viruses, fungi, archeae, etc.  We deal exclusively with sequence-based data, usually measured in the gigabytes and -bases.  Sequencing runs typically produce millions or tens of millions of reads.  Our goal is to derive some useful knowledge from uncultured samples.  We might try to identify pathogens in human wounds, protein function in open ocean water, or relative abundance of microbes in soil.
