# Bioinformatics

The field of "bioinformatics" is biology plus data science.  For the latter, most people find Unix-like operating systems to be the most efficient way to conduct research. I suggest you read the "Unix philosophy" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy) to understand why Unix is the preferred research computing platform.  The idea of chaining small, well-defined tools together to create complex programs directly correlates to much of bioinformatics where we may use half a dozen programs to go from sequence data to functional annotation.  Almost all our tools run in Unix, most of them from the command line, so the bioinformatician must know how to move data around, run programs, and chain the output of one program into another to create analysis pipelines.

# Metagenomics

Metagenomics is a subset of bioinformatics where we deal with unknown communities of organisms comprised of bacteria, viruses, fungi, archeae, etc.  We deal exclusively with sequence-based data, usually measured in the gigabytes and -bases.  Sequencing runs typically produce millions or tens of millions of reads.
