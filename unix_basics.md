# Unix basics

## University of Arizona HPC

We need to get into a Unix system.  If you're on Linux or OSX, open a terminal and type:

  ssh <NetID>@hpc.arizona.edu

Protocol about setting up SSH keys to get around two-factor authentication.

If all goes well, you should be on a machine called "gatekeeper.hpc.arizona.edu."  Verfiy this with the command "hostname<Enter>".  Use the command "menuon" to get the following menu:

```===============
HPC.ARIZONA.EDU
===============
Please select a target system to connect to:

(1) Ocelote
(2) El Gato
(3) Cluster/HTC/SMP
(Q) Quit
(D) Disable menu```

The menu will be present on your next login session.
