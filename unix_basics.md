# Why Unix?

I suggest you read the "Unix philosophy" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy) to understand why Unix is the preferred research computing platform.  The idea of chaining small, well-defined tools together to create complex programs directly correlates to much of bioinformatics where we may use half a dozen programs to go from sequence data to functional annotation.
