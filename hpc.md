# HPC

HPC is an acronym for "high-performance computing," and it generally means using a cluster of computers.  Our students have access to two clusters at the University of Arizona, and most anyone is welcome to use the clusters at TACC.  To use the cluster, it's necessary to submit a batch job along with a description of the resources you need (e.g., memory, number of CPUs, number of nodes) to a scheduler that will start your job when the resources become available.  We will discuss schedulers "PBS" used at UA and "SLURM" used at TACC.
