# CSV Files

Delimited text files are a standard way to distribute non-hierarchical data -- e.g., records that can be represented each on one line.  \(When you get into data that have relationships, e.g., parents/children, then structures like XML and JSON are more appropriate.\)  Let's first take a look at the `csv` module in Python \(https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html\) to parse the output from Centrifuge \(http://www.ccb.jhu.edu/software/centrifuge/\).

For this, we'll use some data from a study from Yellowstone National Park \(https://www.imicrobe.us/sample/view/1378\).  For each input file, Centrifuge creates two output files: 1\) a file \("YELLOWSTONE\_SMPL\_20723.sum"\) showing the taxonomy ID for each read it was able to classify and 2\) a file \("YELLOWSTONE\_SMPL\_20723.tsv"\) of the complete taxonomy information for each taxonomy ID.  One record from the first looks like this:

```
      readID: Yellowstone_READ_00007510
       seqID: cid|321327
       taxID: 321327
       score: 640000
2ndBestScore: 0
   hitLength: 815
 queryLength: 839
  numMatches: 1
```

One from the second looks like this:

```
          name: synthetic construct
         taxID: 32630
       taxRank: species
    genomeSize: 26537524
      numReads: 19
numUniqueReads: 19
     abundance: 0.0
```

# Read Count by taxID

Let's write a program that shows a table of the number of records for each "taxID":

```
$ cat -n read_count_by_taxid.py
     1	#!/usr/bin/env python3
     2	"""Counts by taxID"""
     3
     4	import csv
     5	import os
     6	import sys
     7	from collections import defaultdict
     8
     9	args = sys.argv[1:]
    10
    11	if len(args) != 1:
    12	    print('Usage: {} SAMPLE.SUM'.format(os.path.basename(sys.argv[0])))
    13	    sys.exit(1)
    14
    15	sum_file = args[0]
    16
    17	_, ext = os.path.splitext(sum_file)
    18	if not ext == '.sum':
    19	    print('File extention "{}" is not ".sum"'.format(ext))
    20	    sys.exit(1)
    21
    22	counts = defaultdict(int)
    23	with open(sum_file) as csvfile:
    24	    reader = csv.DictReader(csvfile, delimiter='\t')
    25	    for row in reader:
    26	        taxID = row['taxID']
    27	        counts[taxID] += 1
    28
    29	print('\t'.join(['count', 'taxID']))
    30	for taxID, count in counts.items():
    31	    print('\t'.join([str(count), taxID]))
```

As always, it prints a "usage" statement when run with no arguments.  It also uses the `os.path.splitext` function to get the file extension and make sure that it is ".sum."  Finally, if the input looks OK, then it uses the `csv.DictReader` module to parse each record of the file into a dictionary:

```
$ ./read_count_by_taxid.py
Usage: read_count_by_taxid.py SAMPLE.SUM
$ ./read_count_by_taxid.py YELLOWSTONE_SMPL_20723.tsv
File extention ".tsv" is not ".sum"
$ ./read_count_by_taxid.py YELLOWSTONE_SMPL_20723.sum
count	taxID
80	321332
6432	321327
19	32630
```

That's a start, but most people would rather see the a species name rather than the NCBI taxonomy ID, so we'll need to go look up  the taxIDs in the ".tsv" file:

```
$ cat -n read_count_by_tax_name.py
     1	#!/usr/bin/env python3
     2	"""Counts by tax name"""
     3
     4	import csv
     5	import os
     6	import sys
     7	from collections import defaultdict
     8
     9	args = sys.argv[1:]
    10
    11	if len(args) != 1:
    12	    print('Usage: {} SAMPLE.SUM'.format(os.path.basename(sys.argv[0])))
    13	    sys.exit(1)
    14
    15	sum_file = args[0]
    16
    17	basename, ext = os.path.splitext(sum_file)
    18	if not ext == '.sum':
    19	    print('File extention "{}" is not ".sum"'.format(ext))
    20	    sys.exit(1)
    21
    22	tsv_file = basename + '.tsv'
    23	if not os.path.isfile(tsv_file):
    24	    print('Cannot find expected TSV "{}"'.format(tsv_file))
    25	    sys.exit(1)
    26
    27	tax_name = {}
    28	with open(tsv_file) as csvfile:
    29	    reader = csv.DictReader(csvfile, delimiter='\t')
    30	    for row in reader:
    31	        tax_name[row['taxID']] = row['name']
    32
    33	counts = defaultdict(int)
    34	with open(sum_file) as csvfile:
    35	    reader = csv.DictReader(csvfile, delimiter='\t')
    36	    for row in reader:
    37	        taxID = row['taxID']
    38	        counts[taxID] += 1
    39
    40	print('\t'.join(['count', 'taxID']))
    41	for taxID, count in counts.items():
    42	    name = tax_name.get(taxID) or 'NA'
    43	    print('\t'.join([str(count), name]))
$ ./read_count_by_tax_name.py YELLOWSTONE_SMPL_20723.sum
count	taxID
6432	Synechococcus sp. JA-3-3Ab
80	Synechococcus sp. JA-2-3B'a(2-13)
19	synthetic construct
```
